`title: "Part X â€“ name here"`  
`author: "Your name here"`   
`date: "12/12/2021"`    
`output:`  
  `html_document:`  
   `theme:`  
     `bootswatch: 'cosmo'`  
    `df_print: paged`  
  `pdf_document: default`  
  
### For the graphs please add this theme:  
  - `+ theme_light()`

### Naming your the Rmarkdowns and associated files (for ease of TA's grading):  
  -  Part1.1_MachineLearning.Rmd (or if all of Part1 is in one RMarkdown: Part1.Rmd)
  - Part1.2_ ... etc. 

### For updating the website: [github repo linked here](https://github.com/amesluo/amesluo.github.io)
  1. In folder \"_posts", you can directly edit your parts in github! 
  2. For readability, its helpful to **bold** important parts, or to use numbered lists
  3. To get divders between sections, the code is  `---`
  4. To get empty line breaks between sections, the code is `<br>`
  5. To insert graph pictures, the code is:  

`\<p align="center" width="100%">`  
     `\<img width="some percentage (i.e. 80%)" src="your source URL here">`  
`\</p>`  

   - You can play around with the width percentage to optimize how big you want your image to be  
   - the second line is tabbed (can see examples of such already in the Posts.md files)  

*Now, how do I get my source URL?*  
1. In folder \"_images", you can directly upload your screenshots in github!
2. After uploading in the \"images" folder, [click on the image and drag it to a new tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Po-Data-Science-Project/SEDA-Maps/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-12%20at%207.54.42%20AM.png?token=AVNFGNY2ZAEACK75VBGP3X3BWXZCW)
3. Copy the URL of the new tab with only the image in it, [that is the **source URL**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Po-Data-Science-Project/SEDA-Maps/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-12%20at%207.56.41%20AM.png?token=AVNFGNYJTAXC35PTJRNGQVTBWXZC6)
4. Insert into the code above ^, and the webpage will now have your image in it (yay!)
